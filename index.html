        <h1>What Kind of Thinker Are You?</h1></div> 
        <div class="sections">       
        <h1>Character 1: Thinker</h1>
        <p>
Description: A thinker is a person who does a lot of thinking. This person may be very intellectual, a great conversationalist, but a really big procrastinator. It may take this person a while before they finally come up with a rational decision. They use logic, consistency, and weigh the pros and cons before diving head first into decision making. </p>
        <h1>Character 2: Feeler</h1>
<p>Description: A feeler will constantly make their decisions based on how others around them will feel by their actions. They are very empathetic and caring. When it comes to discussions, feelings will think of themselves as the subject at hand and will speak on the topic as they feel the topic would want to be spoken of. They are very focused and innovative people.</p>
    <h1>Character 3: Sensor
</h1>
    <p>Description: Sensors are people who are going to make sense of a situation and its possible outcome before making the decision. They think back upon their past experiences before making irrational decisions. They almost always find the best solution for themselves. 
</p>
    <h1>Character 4: Intuitive
</h1>
    <p>Description: The intuitive decision-maker never neglects the gut feeling they have when decision making. They’re very in tune with their emotions and their higher selves. They know what is and what isn’t for them. They notice patterns easily and know how to go about situations that they’ve foreseen as negative. </p></div>

<h2>To find out what kind of thinker you are, answer the following...</h2>
        <p>
             One day before school begins, your bestfriend tells you (he/she) is going to hang out with some of the older kids from school after the school day is over. They ask you to tag along. As your best friend is going more in depth, you realize they are going to do drugs. You’ve never partaken in these kinds of activities before. Your best friend says “It’s better your first time will be with someone you're familiar with.” How would you handle this situation? </p>
        <h2>Answer:</h2>
        <button class="button1">A- I would think about this before I give my friend an answer. It may take the whole school day for me to decide.</button>
      
        <button class="button2">B- I would ask my friend how they would feel if I decided not to come. Even if I decide that I won’t come, I’d let them know maybe we could hang out another time and do something we both enjoy doing together.</button>
        <button class="button3">C- I’d think about what could potentially go wrong, or I’ll reflect back upon situations in my life that went wrong before I make my decision.</button>
        <button class="button4">D-  I’d make my decision based on how I feel in the exact moment my friend asks me.</button>
        <div class="Q&A2"></div>
<p>How many hard decisions do you have to make in a day?
